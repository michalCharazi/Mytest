				<h3 class="title-subsection">Contract Information</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">7.1</span> You may submit orders on this Site, for Services or for Products but no contract will exist in relation to the Services or Products until we (or one of our fulfilment partners) have confirmed to you by email the particulars of your order, the value of your order and the Products or Services (as applicable) you have purchased. Acceptance will be deemed complete and will be deemed for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to you when you are able to access the confirmatory email. This will be without prejudice to your right to cancel as outlined in these terms and conditions and to your statutory rights as a consumer.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">7.2</span> From time to time, the Site may accept pre-orders for Services and/or Products that are not currently available but which are intended to become available shortly. No contract will exist in relation to the Services or Products pre-ordered until we (or one of our fulfilment partners) have confirmed to you by email that the Services are ready to start or the Products are ready to be dispatched (as the case may be). Acceptance will be deemed complete and will be deemed for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to you when you are able to access the confirmatory email. This will be without prejudice to your right to cancel as outlined in these terms and conditions and to your statutory rights as a consumer. Where you submit a pre-order, we do not charge your debit/credit card the full amount until the Services are ready to start or the Products are ready to be dispatched (as the case may be), but we do charge a nominal amount (typically, 10 pence) at the pre-order stage (just to ensure that your debit/credit details are correct) which we will then deduct from the balance to be automatically charged to the same debit/credit card when your order is ready to be fulfilled. </p>



				<h3 class="title-subsection">Pricing, availability and dispatch Information of Products</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">8.1</span> Information displayed on the Site as to pricing and availability is subject to change by Fitbug without notice. Payment for the Products will be made via the Site in accordance with the procedure explained on the Site. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">8.2</span> While we aim to be accurate, any availability information or dispatch estimates on the Site in relation to Products are approximate. As we process your order or pre-order (as the case may be), we will inform you by e-mail if any Products you order turn out to be unavailable. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">8.3</span> In spite of our best efforts, it is possible that a Product or Service may be mispriced on the Site. We do, however, confirm prices as part of our dispatch procedures. Where the actual price is lower than that stated on the Site, we will charge the lower amount and send you the Product. If, however, the actual price is higher than that stated on the Site, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatch or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">8.4</span> Products will be dispatched by Fitbug (or one of our fulfilment partners) to your delivery address as soon as reasonably possible after acceptance of your order and we will endeavour to confirm dispatch to you by email. Delivery charges will be made in accordance with your location and you will be informed of the relevant charge on the Site before you confirm your order. Please note, any orders we accept, which require delivery outside the EU, will be delivered duty unpaid. Fitbug is not liable for loss or damage to Products in transit. If recorded delivery is chosen, you will receive your dispatch notification email with a Royal Mail track and trace number. Once dispatched, Royal Mail will not deem an undelivered parcel to be missing until 15 days has passed. Fitbug cannot send replacement Products until you have notified Fitbug and this 15 day period has expired. Should you receive your original Product at any stage after the replacement Product is delivered to you, you shall return this Product immediately to Fitbug (or one of our fulfilment partners as appropriate).</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">9.4</span> Where Fitbug's partnership with any loyalty scheme or rewards programme ends, Fitbug and/or the relevant partner will notify you of your options. In the discretion of the relevant partner, your membership of the relevant scheme or programme may terminate automatically and you may be awarded as a final award - a number of points based on your average award level up to the date of termination (or the average for a representative section of members if you are within your first month of use of the loyalty scheme/programme in relation to Fitbug). You agree that you will not be entitled to be awarded additional points or any other award or payment in respect of such termination. </p>


				<h3 class="title-subsection">Warranties</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">10.1</span> Fitbug warrants that the Services will be supplied with reasonable skill and care. Also, subject to clause 10.2, Fitbug warrants that the Products will operate materially in accordance with their specifications for a period of 90 days from delivery. Subject to the important liability statement, a refund for the defective Product or replacement of it (at Fitbug's discretion) will be your sole remedy for breach of the warranty in this clause 10.2. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">10.2</span> Fitbug may offer specific guarantees with specific Products, and these will be set out in manuals with the Products. </p>

				<h3 class="title-subsection">Subscription Services</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.1</span> Some Services (such as membership of Fitbug) are offered on a subscription basis. Subscription to such Services may be available for varying commitment periods (e.g. 3 months, 6 months or one year) and you may have a choice of paying an up-front fee for such periods or to pay monthly or on an annual basis as stated on the Site. Additionally, we may offer promotional subscription Services, which offer a one off up-front payment fee (e.g. for 3 months) with a commitment to subscribe for e.g. the following 9 months. Monthly subscription may be available with a twelve month commitment or with no commitment. Payment for the Services will be made via the Site in accordance with the procedure and pricing explained on the Site. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.2</span> If you choose a pay-monthly subscription with no commitment period, the monthly charges will be collected by debit/credit card until we or you cancel your subscription on at least 28 days' notice by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@fitbug.com">info@fitbug.com</a>.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.3</span> If you choose a subscription with a fixed commitment period (e.g. 6 months) then, whether it is pay-monthly or pay up-front, at the end of that period your subscription will automatically convert into a pay-monthly subscription (at the same rate band at which you were paying during the fixed commitment period) which can be cancelled by us or you on 28 days notice (by contacting us at info@fitbug.com). Where such notice is given 28 days or more prior to the end of the fixed commitment period, the subscription will end upon expiry of that period. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.4</span> We will collect all monthly fees due (including those due after the end of a fixed commitment period) from the debit/credit card you tell us about upon registration. As stated above, we may suspend or cancel any Services, including your subscription, in the event of problems with the debit/credit card. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.5</span> Subject to your cooling off right stated in clause 12 and your statutory consumer rights (which remain unaffected by any of these terms), subscription fees are non-refundable. Subscriptions with fixed commitment periods may not be cancelled until all the monthly payments have been made. Any attempt to cancel such payment may result in Fitbug deducting the balance of payments due immediately. </p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.6</span> If your subscription begins with a promotional period, you will be automatically charged for the subscription rates to which you agreed on expiry of that promotional period unless you email us on <a href="mailto:info@fitbug.com">info@fitbug.com</a>.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.7</span> The Bug Care service - which may not be available to you - entitles you to pre-purchase one replacement bug once per 12 month period at a discount to the normal price, which we send to you if you notify us (e.g. in the event that your bug is either lost or stolen). A Bug Care form will need to be completed. It is not an insurance service.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">11.8</span> Any corporate or group membership rates are only available to employees/members of the specified organization or group (or other parties such as contract staff and/or friends or family if the offer is specifically extended to such parties). Any attempt to subscribe to such a plan without entitlement to do so may result in Fitbug deducting the balance of payments due immediately.</p>

				<h3 class="title-subsection">Cooling Off Rights</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">12.1</span> Services: You may cancel Services including any subscription within 7 days after the day of ordering by contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:info@fitbug.com">info@fitbug.com</a> or by writing to 'After Sales' at the address set out in these terms and conditions, save that this right will cease once you use your password to log on to the members only part of the Site or to access the Services ordered (or subscribed for) for the first time during that 7 day period.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">12.2</span> Products: After you receive any Products you will have a 7 day "cooling off" period during which you have a right to cancel the order, and return the Products, without charge.

Products must be labelled with the Returns label included in your delivery documentation and returned by registered post (or any other method requiring the recipient to sign on delivery) unused and in their original undamaged packaging. You are responsible for the costs of returning the Products and we reserve the right to make a charge not exceeding our direct costs of recovering the Products (which we are entitled to do) in the event that you do not return the Products or you return them at our expense. Following you exercising your right of cancellation we will refund any payments made by you excepting and subject to any costs of returning the Products.</p>

				<h3 class="title-subsection">Statutory Rights and Refunds</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">13.1</span> The rights of cancellation and refund and any limitation expressed in these terms and conditions do not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.

				<h3 class="title-subsection">Promotions and important information</h3>

				<p><span class="aubergine">16.1</span> Our "lose 6 inches" and other promotions have terms and conditions attached which you will need to agree to when taking up the promotions. They are in addition to these general terms and conditions.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">16.2</span> It is important that you understand that "body shape" and "overall body shape" and similar terms mean a combination of measurements taken from your chest, arms, legs, hips and waist. It does not refer to any one single measurement.</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">16.3</span> Where a promotion guarantees money back you must make any claim within 1 week of the end of the relevant period (for example, a "lose 6 inches off your body shape in 12 weeks" must be claimed within the 13th week).</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">16.4</span> Where a promotion guarantees money back the refund will be the monthly fees paid for your online subscription, and shall exclude the cost of your original members pack and the non-promotional retail price of the Fitbug you have received (neither of which are not refundable save as set out in our general terms and conditions below).</p>

				<p><span class="aubergine">16.5</span> Finally, once again, guarantees only apply if you keep your side of the bargain as set out in the promotion terms and conditions.</p>
